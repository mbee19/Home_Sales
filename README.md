Module 22 Challenge for Morgan Bee

This challenge was completed using class activities from Module 22, class lecture, and the slides on GitLab. 

I also used these two articles to help refresh my SQL knowledge and assist in writing queries: 
- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_year.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_and.asp

I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help me understand how to cast the view rating as an integer in order to correctly order the ratings in descending numerical order, and it also let me know that in step 5, I should also be rounding the living square feet (over 2000) in order to correctly complete the query.
